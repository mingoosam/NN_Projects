## Neural Networks Projects

Projects created for Dr. Anderson's 2023 Spring Neural Networks (ECE 8770) course at the University of Missouri - Columbia as part of coursework for the MS in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.

Project 1 explores the classification task using a multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN) and a radial basis function network (RBF).

Project 2 explores the use of time sequence networks to predict the outcomes of chess games.

The final project explores the outcome of breaking the skip connections on a u-net encoder-decoder network.
